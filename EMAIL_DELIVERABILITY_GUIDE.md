## üö© Main Problem: Sender Authentication

**Critical Issue:** You're sending from `bacalsomichaelferdinand@gmail.com` through Mailjet.

### Why This Causes Spam Issues:
- Gmail's SPF/DKIM records don't authorize Mailjet to send on its behalf
- Email providers flag this as potential spoofing
- Damages sender reputation

## üéØ Solutions (Prioritized)

### **BEST Solution: Use a Custom Domain**

#### Option A: Get Your Own Domain (Recommended)
1. Purchase a domain (e.g., `mathquest.app`, `mathquest-learning.com`)
   - Cost: ~$10-15/year from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.

2. Set up email on that domain:
   ```
   Sender: noreply@mathquest.app
   Or: support@mathquest.app
   ```

3. Configure Mailjet with your domain:
   - Add domain to Mailjet
   - Set up SPF record in your DNS:
     ```
     TXT: v=spf1 include:spf.mailjet.com ~all
     ```
   - Set up DKIM records (Mailjet provides these)
   - Set up DMARC record:
     ```
     TXT: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
     ```

4. Update `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   mailjet.sender.email=noreply@mathquest.app
   mailjet.sender.name=MathQuest
   ```

#### Option B: Use Mailjet's Subdomain (Quick Fix)
1. In Mailjet dashboard, use their provided subdomain
2. They handle all authentication automatically
3. Example: `noreply@youraccount.mailjet.com`

### **Alternative Solution: Improve Current Setup**

If you must keep using Gmail address, try these:

#### 1. Verify Sender in Mailjet
- Go to Mailjet Dashboard ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Sender Addresses
- Add and verify `bacalsomichaelferdinand@gmail.com`
- This helps, but won't fully solve the issue

#### 2. Warm Up Your Sender Reputation
- Start by sending emails to known good addresses
- Gradually increase volume
- Monitor bounce rates

#### 3. Ask Recipients to Whitelist
- Add instructions in your app: "Check spam folder and mark as 'Not Spam'"
- Add sender to contacts
