    question: "If 4 × (2 × 3) = (4 × 2) × 3, which property is being demonstrated?",
    property: "Associative Property",
    answers: ["Commutative Property", "Associative Property", "Distributive Property", "Identity Property"],
    correctAnswer: "Associative Property",
    explanation: "The associative property states that the way factors are grouped doesn't change the product."
