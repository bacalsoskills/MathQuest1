Always re-run after all answers are given
→ Ensure the project is compiled, tested, and verified after implementing changes or answering a request. Use: .\mvnw spring-boot:run


Only update necessary files
→ Do not modify unrelated files. Only touch files that: 
    - Contain the bug or issue
    - Are required to implement a specific request or feature

Project type:
→ This is a Java Maven project
→ Use Maven commands: 
    - .\mvnw clean install
    - .\mvnw test
    - .\mvnw spring-boot:run


Follow these coding conventions:
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for class names)
- Always write JavaDocs for public methods and classes
- Add comments only when logic is not obvious

Logging:
→ Use SLF4J or Log4j for logging
→ Do not use System.out.println() in production code

Security:
→ Never hardcode credentials or secrets
→ Use environment variables or configuration files

Always validate user input

→ Avoid trusting input directly (especially for REST APIs)
