# React Router Deployment Fix

## Problem
The `/auth/verify` route returns "Not Found" because the deployment platform doesn't know how to handle client-side routes.

## Solution
The following files have been added to fix client-side routing:

### 1. `public/_redirects` (for Netlify)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. `public/vercel.json` (for Vercel)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `public/nginx.conf` (for Nginx servers)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

## For Render.com Deployment

If you're using Render.com, you may need to:

1. **Add a build command** in your Render dashboard:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Set the publish directory** to:
   ```
   build
   ```

3. **Add environment variables** if needed:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://mathquest-dz5n.onrender.com
   ```

## Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://mathquest1-2.onrender.com/` (should work)
- `https://mathquest1-2.onrender.com/auth/verify?token=test` (should now work)
- `https://mathquest1-2.onrender.com/static.txt` (should show test message)

## HashRouter Solution (IMPLEMENTED)

**This solution has been implemented to fix the 404 issues:**

1. **✅ Switched to HashRouter** in `src/App.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   import { HashRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Navigate, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   ```
   
   This makes URLs look like: `https://mathquest1-2.onrender.com/#/auth/verify?token=...`

2. **✅ Updated backend email links** to use hash routing:
   ```java
   String verificationLink = baseUrl + "/#/auth/verify?token=" + token;
   ```

3. **✅ Updated all email verification methods**:
   - Account verification: `/#/auth/verify?token=...`
   - Password reset: `/#/reset-password?token=...`
   - Email update: `/#/users/verify-email?token=...`

## Verification

The email verification should now work properly:
1. User registers → receives email with verification link
2. User clicks link → goes to verification page (no more 404)
3. Verification processes → redirects to login page
